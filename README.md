## Call for Proposals

We're looking for students to speak, host workshops, and lead discussions. These things can be on any topic you like.
If you're passionate about the topic, we want to see you here!

There are 2 round types:

* Cutie Round: A 30-minute session
* Citrus Round: A 1-hour session

Within those rounds, you can host one of the following:

* Speak: Talk about something you're passionate about. The domain is not restrained. A few examples are: the benefits of
doing academic research, how being an Uber driver changed your life, and learning computer science as a non-programmer.
* Host: Teach something! Participants will be from all backgrounds so keep that in mind. A few examples are: how to use Python
to supercharge your life, how to become an artist in 5 easy steps, and how to start doing yoga.
* Lead: Host a discussion. A few examples are: life hacks for students, how to increase club engagement, and how to create
a network.
